# Super Chef
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, November 2022

## Theme
The theme for the Game Jam was "Time for Dinner".  We interpreted this as the game should
revolve around someone handling food, hence the name "Super Chef".  He shoots burgers to feed
the "HungryMan", and blows up pizza boxes to release the pizza contained inside.  It is truly
time for dinner.

## Game Play
The Objective is to simultaneously avoid and explode all pizza boxes and destroy 
all the pizza before the timer runs out. You get extra points for hitting HungryMan

Turn with ASD and propel yourself forward with W.  Shoot with spacebar.

## Impediments
We ran into issues with collisions between Super Chef and the pizza boxes.  Either he or 
the box would not explode, and even after fixing collision polygons and such, we still ran into
issues.  Otherwise, the only issues we had were time constraints and communication setbacks.
